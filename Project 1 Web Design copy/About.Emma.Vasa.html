                <h4>Hi, I’m Emma Vasa, a junior studying English and Strategic Communication. Music and the arts have played a major role in my life since I was young, and I have grown passionate about sharing that love with others. I see BEAM as an opportunity to connect with people who share a similar passion while growing one’s knowledge and connections within the entertainment industry. 


                    When I’m not involved with BEAM, you can usually find me outdoors– outdoors whether it’s camping, hiking, trail running, or hammocking at the park. I also love spending my free time reading, bouldering, spending time with friends, or baking banana bread.
