                <h4>Sophia is a sophomore in the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, majoring in Marketing and minoring in Business Analytics! Outside of Carlson, she is also pursuing a double major in Strategic Communication at the Hubbard School of Journalism. Within the university, Sophia is a part of Delta Sigma Pi, which is a professional business fraternity. She is also a member of Vocal U, which is an a cappella group on campus! Sophia has always been interested in the world of arts, entertainment, and music and how it intersects with business; therefore, she co-founded BEAM so students with a similar interest at the University of Minnesota could get an inside look into the business side of the arts and entertainment industry. She looks forward to the future of BEAM and how it will shape the next generation of business leaders in creative industries!
